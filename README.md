## Resources

Many exercises and lecture materials are in form of Jupyter notebooks with **.ipynb** extensions. Sometimes GitHub may not load them correctly for preview, then you can use [Open in Colab][colab_addon], which is an addon in Chrome to open the notebook in Colab. Alternatively, you can go to [jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer], and paste the link to the notebook for previewing. When working with exercises it is important that you create your own notebooks (.ipynb) or script files (.py).

When installing softwares, unless anything else is stated in the resources, just click next.

When you have finished the exercises in this repo, you can work in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
